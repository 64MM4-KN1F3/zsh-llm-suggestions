# LLM-based command suggestions for zsh

`zsh` commands can be difficult to remember, but LLMs are great at turning
human descriptions of what to do into a command. Enter `zsh-llm-suggestions`:
You describe what you would like to do directly in your prompt, you hit a
keyboard shortcut of your choosing, and the LLM replaces your request with
the command.

## Installation

## Supported LLMs

Right now, two LLMs are supported:
1. GitHub Copilot (via GitHub CLI). Requires a GitHub Copilot subscription.
2. OpenAI. Requires an OpenAI API key.
